# Social Media Application

This project is a social media application which a user can use to create posts and view all posts that have been uploaded by all users. Users can upload a variety of data including mandatory text content and optional photos, gifs or links. Posts includes a mandatory title as well. Users can upvote/downvote all posts, and add comments. The posts with the most votes are listed on top.

Users are required to provide a username at login.

This application is built using Create React App, a template used for making simple front end applications.
